# Change-Calculator
This is an algorithm that prints the exact composition of the change that needs to be returned. The first parameter is total cost, and the second parameter is the amount of cash used to pay for the cost.

```python
calc_change(76.42, 100)

"""

1: $20 Bill
3: $1 Bill
2: Quarter
1: Nickel
3: Penny
